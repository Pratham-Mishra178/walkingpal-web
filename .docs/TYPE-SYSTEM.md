**body1..2** used for long-form writing.
**button** Button text variant is a style applied to the text on buttons
**Caption and overline**: used sparingly to annotate imagery
**overline**: Sparingly used. Mainly Used over headlines to introduce the headline.

### Key Takeaways

- difference between subtitle variant and body variant:
  - Both might look same (same size or same font) but there is little difference other than font weight, i.e, Subtitle should be short (few words) whereas body variant can be as long as you want
- Subtitles are not headlines, they are small size text but dark colored for more emphasis
